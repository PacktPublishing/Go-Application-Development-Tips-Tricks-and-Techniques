## About the Video Course
The goal of this course is to help you develop applications and services with Go efficiently and in high quality. For this, we will start by showing how to effectively edit Go code with Visual Studio Code.

Next, we will move on to two common tasks when building Go programs: handling concurrency and encoding/decoding data into formats like JSON.

After that, we will take a look at various methods that you can use to improve the software quality in your Go project. You will learn how to use the unit testing framework, the build-in memory and CPU profilers and the Delve debugger. Furthermore, you will learn about various tools that you can use for static code analysis to increase your code quality even more.
Finally, you will learn how you can effectively build and distribute your Go applications for a variety of deployment targets.
